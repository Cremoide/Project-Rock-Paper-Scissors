// Since this is the first JavaScript project being built from scratch, itâ€™s important to remember the wise words from the Problem Solving lesson. For each step in this project, be sure to do the following

// Plan or pseudocode your solution:
// SET a random number to COMPUTE the user's INPUT.
// Ask user for an INPUT (paper, rock or scissors).
// Check the INPUT and COMPUTE it for an OUTPUT.
// PRINT the OUTPUT with the results.

// Write the code.
let machineChoice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;

function getComputerChoice(machine){

}

console.log(machineChoice);

// Test your code to make sure it works.
